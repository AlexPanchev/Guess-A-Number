Guess the Number is a simple game where the computer generates a number in the range from 0 to 100. The user's role is to guess the number generated by the computer in a certain number of trials. If he guesses it, he gets congratulations message. If he doesn't manage to guess it in the set number of times, he loses the game and has the optin to start again with a new number generated by the computer. The game ends either when the user indicates that they do not want to play again.
